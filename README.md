## What is this project?

This is a decidedly opinionated SvelteKit template, packed with modern technologies and industry best practices. It offers a comprehensive array of features with the main goal of saving a lot of time when configuring a brand new project, removing all the tedious boilerplate that comes at the start and allowing developers to focus on building the core features of their projects. Its flexible design and modular approach make it easy to customize for various project requirements.

## Prerequisites

- Use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for running commands and install dependencies. Or use [Node](https://nodejs.org)/[Deno](https://deno.com) by removing `bun.lockb`, installing the corresponding SvelteKit adapter, updating `svelte.config.js`, and removing `svelte-adapter-bun`.

- The project uses external systems: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database and [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) for local email testing (more can be added later). Traditionally, these require local installation, but you can use [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) and the included [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) (`docker-compose.yaml`) to run dependencies in containers (see [Setting up the project locally](#setting-up-the-project-locally)).

### Summary

- Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/), or [Node](https://nodejs.org), or [Deno](https://deno.com).
- (Optional) Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose).

## Creating a new project from this template

You have multiple options to start a new project based on this template:

- [Create a GitHub repo from this template](https://github.com/MesaTechLabs/kitten/generate).
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/MesaTechLabs/kitten/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) from the GitHub repository, which excludes the `.git` directory.
- Scaffold the project using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).

  ```sh
  bunx degit MesaTechLabs/kitten my-new-project
  ```

Alternatively, you can fork it on StackBlitz, an online IDE:  

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/jm2097/angular-boilerplate)

## Setting up the project locally

1. Clone the project using one of the options from the "Creating a new project from this template" section.
2. Install the project dependencies:

    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

3. Configure environment variables by copying the example file and filling in all required variables:

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Start the PostgreSQL and MailHog Docker containers:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5. Create a local database instance by running the database migrations:

    ```sh
    bun run postgres:push
    ```

6. Run the project:

    ```sh
    bun run dev
    ```
